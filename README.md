# Project: Forged

# Version: 0.0.1

# Learning Outcomes:

1. Better understanding of Next.js
2. Learn how to utilize Material-ui with Next.js
3. If this turns out well, I will use it as portfolio project and perhaps a
   template for future freelance work.

# Project Description:

Create a small business website to practice using Next.js with Material-ui.

My primary goal is to learn how to handle content in Next.js and learn more
about Material-ui. As such, I will not be focused on creating in-depth CSS
styling or custom content.

Most of images will be stock photos from unsplash/pexel. The written content
will likely be Lorem ipsum.

# Features:

- Responsive Navbar
- Landing/Home page
- About Page
- Project page
- Services page
- Contact Page with a working contact form
- Basic Footer with a sitemap and copyright info

# Version History:

Version 0.0.1:

Added the basic boilerplate and implemented \_document.jsx.

This file injects a CSS stylesheet which enables the use of Material-ui.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This
endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are
treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead
of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js
  features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out
[the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

[Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
